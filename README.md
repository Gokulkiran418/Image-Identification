# Files
## genmodel.py
Creates the model.
 Saves the model.
 Change file path like this if you want to save the model somewhere else
 model.save('G:\\file\\path\\toSave\\cifar10_model.h5')
## predict.py
 This is just an additional function I added.
  You can load any image that relates to the classes in cifar 10 dataset.
  (airplane,automobile,bird,cat,deer,dog,frog,horse,ship,truck).
  When you run the code it predicts and prints the class of image.
  In the file change the variable image_path to the image file path.
 ## cifar10_model.h5
 It is the sample model I uploaded, when you run genmodel.py,
  you can also create one
 ## imageclassification.ipynb
   data analytics of the cifar 10 dataset.

  # Prerequisites
   install conda for easier installation of tensorflow and all packages.
